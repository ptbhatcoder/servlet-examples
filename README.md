# servlet-examples
This repository contains sub-projects which I made while learning servlets.

The following examples are there:
## HelloWorld Servlet
The Hello World servlet takes a GET request from the client and then sends a response to the server which contains information about the basic details of the server,of course, something which also can be achieved using an OPTIONS request without using and Java servlet programming at all, but this will void the purpose of the learning involved in mastering servlet programming in java
